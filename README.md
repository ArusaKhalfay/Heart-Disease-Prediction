# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early diagnosis plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical factors. Using an XGBoost classifier, the model analyzes features like cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and maximum heart rate, achieving an impressive accuracy of **85.3%**.

This project serves as a valuable resource for healthcare professionals and researchers, offering insights into the key contributors to heart disease and facilitating data-driven decision-making.

## Project Highlights
- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Classifier, known for its speed and accuracy in tabular data analysis.
- **Clinical Factors Analyzed**: 
  - Cholesterol levels
  - Blood pressure
  - Maximum heart rate
  - Other demographic and clinical attributes
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis and visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the publicly available UCI Heart Disease dataset, which includes 303 records and 14 attributes. These attributes capture a mix of demographic data (e.g., age, sex), lifestyle factors, and clinical measurements, making it ideal for predicting heart disease.

## Results
The XGBoost model identifies critical clinical factors influencing heart disease risk, enabling accurate predictions. This can support early intervention strategies and contribute to better patient care. The project also includes feature importance analysis to highlight the most significant contributors to heart disease.

## Potential Applications
- **Healthcare Decision Support**: Assisting clinicians in identifying high-risk patients.
- **Preventive Care**: Enabling targeted lifestyle interventions based on predictive insights.
- **Research**: Providing a robust baseline model for further studies in predictive healthcare analytics.
